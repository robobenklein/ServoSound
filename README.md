# Test Board Project
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LN-STEMpunks/TestBoard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LN-STEMpunks/TestBoard)

This is the codebase for trying out code on our testing platform.

This branch may contain experimental code, so if multiple people wish to develop testing projects, fork a new repo.
